# 1. Deployment pipeline

## 1.1. Background

### 1.1.1. Background

This project supports:

- the python evaluation of Keras ACDNET20 models
- the conversion of ACDNET20 models to TFLite 
- the deployment of applications to evaluate the accuracy of the models onto both Sony Spresense and x86_64 Ubuntu 20.04

2. Run the dataset generation scripts from main folder
   ```python common/prepare_dataset.py```
   ```python common/val_generator.py```
3. Install ```xxd``` to support tflite conversion
4. Add user to `dialout` group, then logout and login to activate 
   ```sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER```
5. Run `setup.sh` in `deployment` folder

## 1.3. Setup  <a name="setup"></a>

### 1.3.1. Automatic Setup (recommended)

Executing the setup script will perform all necessary preparations outlined below
- creating a python virtual environment
- install required python packages
- downloading and building the dependencies
- installing TensorFlow, spresense_sdk, Nuttx, symlinks and additional libraries

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### 1.3.2. Manual Setup

Recommendation is to use a virtual environment as there are several python dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 1.3.2.1. TensorFlow setup

Clone TensorFlow repository
```bash
(cd ext && git clone --branch=v2.3.1 --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git)
```

Download the TFLite build dependencies

```bash
(cd ext/tensorflow && ./tensorflow/lite/tools/make/download_dependencies.sh)
```

Apply each TensorFlow patch

```bash
(cd ext/tensorflow && git apply --reject --whitespace=fix ext/patches/tensorflow/{filename}.patch)
```

Build the tflite library for the local OS

```bash
(cd ext/tensorflow && ./tensorflow/lite/tools/make/build_lib.sh)
```

Create the tflite micro library for the local OS

```bash
(cd ext/tensorflow && make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile microlite)
```

#### 1.3.2.2. Spresense setup

The Spresense SDK is required by the TFLITE_MICRO project

The following steps can be used to manually install the Spresense SDK, and apply the necessary patches

Install Build tools

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonydevworld/spresense/master/install-tools.sh
chmod 775 install-tools.sh
./install-tools.sh
rm install-tools.sh
```

Install Spresense SDK

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout \$USER
git clone --branch=v2.0.1 --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sonydevworld/spresense.git spresense
git clone --depth=1 https://bitbucket.org/acassis/libcxx  ext/libcxx
(cd ext/libcxx; ./install.sh ext/spresense/nuttx)
cp ext/patches/libcxx/optional.cxx ext/spresense/nuttx/libs/libxx/libcxx
```

Apply each Spresense patch

```bash
(cd ext/spresense && git apply --reject --whitespace=fix ext/patches/spresense/{filename}.patch)
```

Apply each Nuttx patch

```bash
(cd ext/spresense && git apply --reject --whitespace=fix ext/patches/spresense/{filename}.patch)
```

#### Install Flatbuffers

The FlatBuffers library is required by the TFLITE_x86_64 project

```bash
cd ext
git clone --depth=1 --branch v1.12.0 https://github.com/google/flatbuffers.git
```

#### 1.3.2.3. Install Symbolic Links 

The project uses symbolic links to tidy up the folder structure, and avoid duplicate copies of external repositories

```bash
cd ext
ln -s ../src/tflite_micro spresense/examples/tflite_micro
ln -s ../src/tflite_micro_config spresense/sdk/configs/examples/tflite_micro
ln -s tensorflow spresense/examples/tflite_micro/tensorflow
```


## 1.4. Conversion of models <a name="convert"></a>

Execute the python script to automatically convert all models

```bash
./convert_model.py {path/to/model.h5} {fold}
```

*Where*
- model.h5 is a valid pretrained Keras model
- [Optional] fold is a number in range [1 - 5]

*Results*
- TFLite are written automatically to `src/models/{model_file}_{dataset}_fold{fold}.tflite` 
- CC are written automatically to `src/models/{model_file}_{dtype}_fold{fold}.cc`
- Accuracy results are written automatically to `results/result_{yymmdd}_{hhmm}.npy`

## 1.5. Data sources  <a name="gendata"></a>

Evaluation data used by the model is supplied in the form of compressed Numpy npz files which contain:

- **'x'** the audio sample features
- **'y'** the expected classification output

In the context of this repository there are two sorts of npz files

- 'test' data, used to evaluate accuracy
- 'representation' data used to supply the TFLite conversion with a representative data set

### 1.5.1. Generate Raw Source Data

To create the prerequisite RAW files, containing the audio features needed for both TFLITE_X86_64 and TFLITE_MICRO, it is necessary to run a script.  The script, below, populates the `data/` folder with the generated files.

```bash
generate_raw_data.py {model_path} --fold {fold_number}
```

When copying data to the microSD card, it is recommended to copy the selected dataset of *.RAW files (4000 in total) and scores.bin (1 file) from the generated data path into a `data` folder on the microSD.
